# JS-2-XO-Game

Welcome to the game TIC TAC TOE 3x3.
Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) in an empty cell.
The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins.
If the board fills up without any player getting three in a row, the game is a draw.

This project was built using pure HTML5 & CSS3 & JavaScript.
